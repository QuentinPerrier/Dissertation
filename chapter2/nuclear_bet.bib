abstract = {This article analyses how a capacity mechanism can address security of supply objectives in a power market undergoing an energy transition that combines energy efficiency efforts to stabilise demand and a rapid increase in the proportion of renewables. To analyse this situation, power markets are simulated over the long term with a System Dynamics model integrating new investment and closure decisions. This last trait is relevant to studying investment in power generation in mature markets undergoing policy shocks. The energy-only market design with a price cap, with and without a capacity mechanism, is compared to scarcity pricing in two investment behaviour scenarios with and without risk aversion. The results show that the three market designs lead to different levels of risk for peaking unit investment and results thus differ according to which risk aversion hypothesis is adopted. Assuming a risk-neutral investor, the results indicate that compared to an energy-only market with a price cap at 3 000 €/MWh, an energy-only market with scarcity pricing and the market design with a capacity mechanism are two efficient options to reach similar levels of load loss. But under the hypothesis of risk aversion, the results highlight the advantage of the capacity mechanism over scarcity pricing.},

abstract = {The existing literature on the construction costs of nuclear power reactors has focused almost exclusively on trends in construction costs in only two countries, the United States and France, and during two decades, the 1970s and 1980s. These analyses, Koomey and Hultman (2007); Grubler (2010), and Escobar-Rangel and L{\'{e}}v{\^{e}}que (2015), study only 26{\%} of reactors built globally between 1960 and 2010, providing an incomplete picture of the economic evolution of nuclear power construction. This study curates historical reactor-specific overnight construction cost (OCC) data that broaden the scope of study substantially, covering the full cost history for 349 reactors in the US, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea, encompassing 58{\%} of all reactors built globally. We find that trends in costs have varied significantly in magnitude and in structure by era, country, and experience. In contrast to the rapid cost escalation that characterized nuclear construction in the United States, we find evidence of much milder cost escalation in many countries, including absolute cost declines in some countries and specific eras. Our new findings suggest that there is no inherent cost escalation trend associated with nuclear technology.},

Ample evidence exists that for many problems simple optimization (particularly profit maximization) does not represent the aims of management. In this paper we discuss the nature of the problem situations for which alternative decision criteria are more appropriate. In particular the structure of strategic planning problems is analysed. The provisional commitment involved in a plan (in contrast to the irrevocable commitment of a decision) leads to the development of a particular criterion, robustness-a measure of the flexibility which an initial decision of a plan maintains for achieving near-optimal states in conditions of uncertainty. The robustness concept is developed through the case study of a sequential factory location problem.},

There is a wide range of models under this new hybrid regime which essentially combine the energy market with planning and long-term risk transfer arrangements. This paper takes an institutionalist approach in terms of modularity of the market design, and reviews the issues with the standard historical market model which led to the introduction of additional long term “modules”. We then study the interactions between the existing and new “modules” and identify ways in which the initial market modules can be improved to address inconsistencies with the new modules. We conclude by discussing the conditions under which the various changes in market architectures could converge toward a hybrid regime structured around a “two step competition”, with a “competition for the market” via the auctioning of long-term contracts to support investment, followed by “competition in the market” for short term system optimisation via the energy market.},

abstract = {The unprecedented resources and energy needed to support the high growth of urbanization with the emerging issues of environmental degradation and GHG emissions is increasingly dramatic in China. A series of national and local policies have been implemented for achieving the co-benefits of reducing emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollution for China's sustainable development. In this paper, the achievement of climate change mitigation and air pollution reduction in different sectors through implementing policies is reviewed. This paper reports on the types of policy measures that have been introduced in two cases (i.e. Tiexi District of Shenyang and Baoshan District of Shanghai) to affect air quality and energy efficiency improvements, which are then collectively examined in terms of their impacts on GHG and air pollutant emissions. Recommendations are made for achieving co-benefits effectively through the integrated approach by comprehensively concentrating on the short and long-term environmental protection and energy conservation at local and national levels based on the analysis made in the paper. The limited coordination and lack of capacity in different government bodies may be the main barriers to the implementation of a co-benefits approach. Enhancing the cooperation and capacity building could overcome these obstacles.},

While policy analyses often invoke assumptions of power plant book life, relatively little analysis has focused on the physical life of power-generating assets. The average age of the U.S. generator fleet has increased significantly over time despite continued investment, in part because more recent investment has tended to focus on shorter-lived assets. This may be due in part to risk-averse power sector investors and lenders responding rationally to regulatory uncertainty in a deregulated market environment. Power plant retirement trends suggest that the pace of retirements will increase significantly in the decade after 2030 for most reasonable estimates of physical life. These capital investment trends have important consequences for carbon policy and highlight the importance of including consideration of the longer term—particularly when evaluating more significant decarbonization policies.},

abstract = {The complementary features of low-carbon power sources are a central issue in designing energy transition policies. The French current electricity mix is characterised by a high share of nuclear power which equalled 76{\%} of the total electric production in 2015. With the increase in intermittent renewable sources, nuclear flexibility is examined as part of the solution to balance electricity supply and demand. Our proposed methodology involves designing scenarios with nuclear and intermittent renewable penetration levels, and developing residual load duration curves in each case. The load modulation impact on the nuclear production cost is estimated.This article shows to which extent the nuclear annual energy production will decrease with high shares of intermittent renewables (down to load factors of 40{\%} for proactive assumptions). However, the production cost increase could be compensated by progressively replacing the plants. Moreover, incentives are necessary if nuclear is to compete with combined-cycle gas turbines as its alternative back-up option.In order to reconcile the social planner with plant operator goals, the solution could be to find new outlets rather than reducing nuclear load factors. Nuclear flexibility could then be considered in terms of using its power to produce heat or hydrogen.},

Inappropriate aggregation of temporal resolution can introduce substantial error into model outputs and associated economic insight. The mechanisms underlying the introduction of this error are shown. How many representative periods are needed to fully capture the variability is then investigated. For a sample dataset, a scenario-robust aggregation of hourly (8760) resolution is possible in the order of 10 representative hours when electricity demand is the only source of variability. The inclusion of wind and solar supply variability increases the resolution of the robust aggregation to the order of 1000. A similar scale of expansion is shown for representative days and weeks. These concepts can be applied to any such temporal dataset, providing, at the least, a benchmark that any other aggregation method can aim to emulate. How prior information about peak pricing hours can potentially reduce resolution further is also discussed.},

We explore the ability of different models – multinomial logit, random parameters logit, and hybrid latent class – and of different choice paradigms – utility maximization and regret minimization – in explaining people's choices for renewable energy programmes. The “pure” random regret random parameters logit model explains the choices of our respondents better than other models, indicating that regret is an important choice paradigm, and that choices for renewable energy programmes are mostly driven by regret, rather than by rejoice. In particular, we find that our respondents' choices are driven more by changes in greenhouse gas emissions than by reductions in power outages. Finally, we find that changing the level of information to one attribute has no effect on choices, and that being a member of an environmental organization makes a respondent more likely to be associated with the utility maximization choice framework.},

abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the market value of variable renewable energy (VRE). The inherent variability of wind speeds and solar radiation affects the price that VRE generators receive on the market (market value). During windy and sunny times the additional electricity supply reduces the prices. Because the drop is larger with more installed capacity, the market value of VRE falls with higher penetration rate. This study aims to develop a better understanding on how the market value with penetration, and how policies and prices affect the market value. Quantitative evidence is derived from a review of published studies, regression analysis of market data, and the calibrated model of the European electricity market EMMA. We find the value of wind power to fall from 110{\%} of the average power price to 50-80{\%} as wind penetration increases from zero to 30{\%} of total electricity consumption. For solar power, similarly low value levels are reached already at 15{\%} penetration. Hence, competitive large-scale renewable deployment will be more difficult to accomplish than as many anticipate. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The target is to quantify how fuel and carbon price risk impacts investment incentives of thermal power plants. We provide a framework for the evaluation of investment decisions under long-term uncertainty which helps integrating numerous scenarios in one single model and including security criteria such as minimum system capacity constraints. It is shown that outcomes of optimization under risk differ by the type of model used---deterministic or stochastic. The managerial implication is that private investors should take into account long-term uncertainty in integrated stochastic models instead of using scenario analysis with deterministic models. In doing so, investors account for the flexibility in second-stage decision-making after investment. Optimal decisions paths thus differ by the type of model used. Results point to findings which are in line with general theory: Accounting for stochasticity increases investment levels overall and the investment portfolio tends to become more diverse.},

abstract = {This paper utilizes the recent methodology of clustered integer unit commitment (UC) - which tractably captures operational flexibility within generation expansion planning - to explore which operating constraints are the most important for generation investment decisions. Flexibility has been previously shown to alter the optimal generation mix, particularly in scenarios with high flexibility required by significant renewables ({\textgreater}=20{\%}) and/or decreased flexibility of some low-carbon technologies (e.g. traditional nuclear). This work explores the potential to relax some operating constraints to speed-up computation while controlling errors. It is found that operating reserves and maintenance are the most important constraints, while hour-to-hour ramping is least important. However, relaxing integers provides the best accuracy vs. performance trade-offs, but only when the linear program (LP) relaxation includes the full problem with UC constraints. This reduces computation time ∼50× with the lowest errors across all metrics: cost (-1{\%}), CO2 (-1{\%}), capacity (-9{\%}), and energy mix (-9{\%}). Considerably high speed ups are possible using the LP relaxed formulation with selected subsets of UC constraints. For cost and CO2, the combination of grouped reserves, ramping, maintenance, and LP provides errors around 2{\%} with ∼1500× speedup. However, for capacity and energy mixes, only LP provides reasonable errors ({\textless}25{\%}).},

To account for this, analysts sometimes conduct sensitivity analysis with respect to key exogenous variables. This paper presents a practical approach for conducting systematic sensitivity analysis, called Gaussian quadrature. The approach views key exogenous variables as random variables with associated distributions. It produces estimates of means and standard deviations of model results while requiring a limited number of solves of the model. Under mild conditions, all of which hold with respect to the GTAP model, there is strong reason to believe that the estimates of means and standard deviations will be quite accurate.},

However, in the great majority of studies with a handful of scenarios or scenario categories, both scenario developers and users capture only a subset of future uncertainties.

If these focal points are adopted, scenario studies in climate and energy analysis shall not simply stop after producing scenarios, but shall continue with techniques to facilitate elicitation of user-specific insights, as well as evaluation of both scenarios and scenario techniques.},

abstract = {Scenarios exist so that decision makers and those who provide them with infor- mation can make statements about the future that claim less confidence than do predictions, projections, and forecasts. Despite their prevalence, fundamental questions remain about how scenarios should best be developed and used. This paper proposes a particular concep- tualization of scenarios that aims to address many of the challenges faced when using scenarios to inform contentious policy debates. The concept envisions scenarios as illumi- nating the vulnerabilities of proposed policies, that is, as concise summaries of the future states of the world in which a proposed policy would fail to meet its goals. Such scenarios emerge from a decision support process that begins with a proposed policy, seeks to understand the conditions under which it would fail, and then uses this information to identify and evaluate potential alternative policies that are robust over a wide range of future conditions. Statistical cluster analyses applied to databases of simulation model results can help identify scenarios as part of this process. Drawing on themes from the decision support literature, this paper first reviews difficulties faced when using scenarios to inform climate- related decisions, describes the proposed approach to address these challenges, illustrates the approach with applications for three different types of users, and concludes with some thoughts on implications for the provision of climate information and for future scenario processes.},

abstract = {With an increasing share of wind and solar energy in power generation, properly accounting for their temporal and spatial variability becomes ever more important in power system modeling. To this end, a high temporal resolution is desirable but due to computational restrictions rarely feasible in long-term models that span several decades. Therefore many of these models only include a small number of representative ???time slices??? that aggregate periods with similar load and renewable electricity generation levels. The deliberate selection of the time slices to consider in a model is vital, as an inadequate choice may significantly distort the model outcome. However, established selection methods are only based on demand variations and are not applicable to input data with a large number of fluctuating time series, which is a drawback for models with high shares of renewable energy. In this paper, we present and validate a novel and computational efficient time slice approach that is readily applicable to input data for all kinds of power system models. We illustratively determine representative days for the long-term model LIMES-EU and show that a small number of model days developed in this way is sufficient to reflect the characteristic fluctuations of the input data.},

This paper describes a new approach to participatory, computer-assisted scenario development that we call scenario discovery, which aims to address these challenges. The approach defines scenarios as a set of plausible future states of the world that represent vulnerabilities of proposed policies, that is, cases where a policy fails to meet its performance goals. Scenario discovery characterizes such sets by helping users to apply statistical or data-mining algorithms to databases of simulation-model-generated results in order to identify easy-to-interpret combinations of uncertain model input parameters that are highly predictive of these policy-relevant cases. The approach has already proved successful in several high impact policy studies. This paper systematically describes the scenario discovery concept and its implementation, presents statistical tests to evaluate the resulting scenarios, and demonstrates the approach on an example policy problem involving the efficacy of a proposed U.S. renewable energy standard. The paper also describes how scenario discovery appears to address several outstanding challenges faced when applying traditional scenario approaches in contentious public debates. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Second, uncertainty in future climate makes it impossible to directly use the output of a single climate model as an input for infrastructure design, and there are good reasons to think that the needed climate information will not be available soon. Instead of optimizing based on the climate conditions projected by models, therefore, future infrastructure should be made more robust to possible changes in climate conditions. This aim implies that users of climate information must also change their practices and decision-making frameworks, for instance by adapting the uncertainty-management methods they currently apply to exchange rates or R{\&}D outcomes. Five methods are examined: (i) selecting “no-regret” strategies that yield benefits even in absence of climate change; (ii) favouring reversible and flexible options; (iii) buying “safety margins” in new investments; (iv) promoting soft adaptation strategies, including long-term prospective; and (v) reducing decision time horizons. Moreover, it is essential to consider both negative and positive side-effects and externalities of adaptation measures. Adaptation–mitigation interactions also call for integrated design and assessment of adaptation and mitigation policies, which are often developed by distinct communities.},

abstract = {Electricity market models, implemented as dynamic programming problems, have been applied widely to identify possible pathways towards a cost-optimal and low carbon electricity system. However, the joint optimization of generation and transmission remains challenging, mainly due to the fact that commercial trades do not directly translate into power flows on a specific line in meshed networks. Instead, loop flows occur and potentially impact the entire transmission system. This paper presents a methodology that allows optimizing transmission investments under flow-based market coupling and complements established electricity market models implemented in a linear programming environment that are suitable for solving large-scale problems. The algorithm developed is based on a linear ‘DC' representation of the physical load flow equations, expressed as power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs). It iteratively updates the PTDFs when grid infrastructures are modified due to cost-optimal extension and thus yields an optimal solution with a consistent representation of physical load flows. The method is first demonstrated on a simplified three-node model where it is found to be robust and convergent. It is then applied to the European power system in order to find its cost-optimal development under the prescription of strongly decreasing CO2 emissions until 2050.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes a study of the transition of the United States nuclear industry from a prescriptive regulatory structure to a more risk informed approach to operations and regulations. The transition occurred over a 20 yr period in which gradual changes were made in the fundamental regulations and to the approach to nuclear safety and operations. While the number of actual regulatory changes were few, they are continuing. The utilities that embraced risk informed operations made dramatic changes in the way they approached operations and outage management. Those utilities that used risk in operations showed dramatic improvement in safety based on Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) performance indicators. It was also shown that the use of risk did not negatively affect safety performance of the plants compared to standard prescriptive approaches. This was despite having greater flexibility in compliance to regulatory standards and the use of the newly instituted risk-informed reactor oversight process. Key factors affecting the successful transition to a more risk-informed approach to regulations and operations are: strong top management support and leadership both at the regulator and the utility; education and training in risk principles and probabilistic risk Assessment tools for engineers, operators and maintenance staff; a slow and steady introduction of risk initiatives in areas that can show value to both the regulator and the industry; a transparent regulatory foundation built around a safety goal policy and the development of a strong safety culture at the utility to allow for more independence in safety compliance and risk management. The experience of the United States shows positive results in both safety and economics. The INPO and NRC metrics presented show that the use of risk information in operations and regulation is marginally better with no degradation in safety when plants that have embraced risk-informed approaches are compared to those that have not. The use of risk-informed approaches allows both the regulator and the industry to focus on important safety issues. The transition to risk-informed regulation also required a "culture change" by both the regulators and the utilities. Caution should be taken, however, since the basis of the US transition to risk-informed regulation is founded on a long history of a regulatory structure and practices that have matured the industry to a point where the next step could be taken. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {LCOE (levelized costs of electricity) are a common metric for comparing power generating technologies. However, there is criticism particularly towards evaluating variable renewables like wind and solar PV (photovoltaics) power based on LCOE because it ignores variability and integration costs. We propose a new metric System LCOE that accounts for integration and generation costs. For this purpose we develop a new mathematical definition of integration costs that directly relates to economic theory. As a result System LCOE allow the economic comparison of generating technologies and deriving optimal quantities in particular for VRE (variable renewable sources). To demonstrate the new concept we quantify System LCOE from a simple power system model and literature values. We find that at high wind shares integration costs can be in the same range as generation costs of wind power and conventional plants in particular due to a cost component "profile costs" captured by the new definition. Integration costs increase with growing wind shares and might become an economic barrier to deploying VRE at high shares. System LCOE help understanding and resolving the challenge of integrating VRE and can guide research and policy makers in realizing a cost-efficient transformation towards an energy system with potentially high shares of variable renewables. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {How to compute the probability of a nuclear accident by using past observations? How the observation of the last catastrophe at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant changed the expected frequency for such events? Little has been the consensus in answering these questions. While opponents of nuclear power claim that the probability of serious accident is very high, the industry ensures that it is negligible. The aim of our paper is to shed light in this controversy by using historical data and an appropriate statistical model. In order to address these questions, we have compared four Poisson models using three different definitions of nuclear accidents from 1952 to 2012. We found that as the definition of accident takes into account other events, (i.e. not only the major nuclear disasters but also less serious accidents) the independence assumption underlying the three first Poisson models is violated. This result called for a time-varying mean model, such as the Poisson Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (PEWMA). By using this last model we find a greater increase in the risk of a core meltdown accident, owing to the accident that took place in Japan in 2011, than the estimates that we obtained using the classic Poisson models. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The events of March 2011 at the nuclear power complex in Fukushima, Japan, raised questions about the safe operation of nuclear power plants, with early retirement of existing nuclear power plants being debated in the policy arena and considered by regulators. Also, the future of building new nuclear power plants is highly uncertain. Should nuclear power policies become more restrictive, one potential option for climate change mitigation will be less available. However, a systematic analysis of nuclear power policies, including early retirement, has been missing in the climate change mitigation literature. We apply an energy economy model framework to derive scenarios and analyze the interactions and tradeoffs between these two policy fields. Our results indicate that early retirement of nuclear power plants leads to discounted cumulative global GDP losses of 0.07{\%} by 2020. If, in addition, new nuclear investments are excluded, total losses will double. The effect of climate policies imposed by an intertemporal carbon budget on incremental costs of policies restricting nuclear power use is small. However, climate policies have much larger impacts than policies restricting the use of nuclear power. The carbon budget leads to cumulative discounted near term reductions of global GDP of 0.64{\%} until 2020. Intertemporal flexibility of the carbon budget approach enables higher near-term emissions as a result of increased power generation from natural gas to fill the emerging gap in electricity supply, while still remaining within the overall carbon budget. Demand reductions and efficiency improvements are the second major response strategy.},

It is invoked as the principal argument for continuing major government intervention. Yet there exists no formal analytical basis for the concept. Why is diversity good? What is meant by 'diversification'? What is it that must be 'diversified'? What trade off should be struck between 'diversity' and other measures of performance? The resulting ambiguity causes confusion and is vulnerable to special pleading. Despite this, this paper argues that diversification offers a superior alternative to probabilistic approaches towards uncertainty and ignorance in electricity supply investments and proposes a formal analytical approach. A quantitative index of diversity is borrowed from information theory and used to derive a value for the government's implicit willingness to pay for diversity in the UK electricity supply mix. This is then applied in a pilot exercise to the problem of optimizing the diversity and financial performance of the supply portfolio. Although provisional, the results are relevant to the government's forthcoming Nuclear Review, particularly in assessing the relative levels of support for nuclear power and renewable energy. ?? 1994.},

The advantages and disadvantages of input-output methods and analysis methods are discussed as well as the issues surrounding the measurement of job creation.

However, most studies carried out in the past have focused on specific countries and those with a European-wide scope have not provided disaggregated results per country. Furthermore, differences between importing and exporting countries have not been considered. This paper aims to cover those gaps. It presents a novel methodology which integrates the aforementioned considerations in order to calculate the employment effects of renewable energy deployment. The methodology is useful to calculate dynamic employment factors (considering technology learning effects) and the specific capacity (based on trade effects) to which these factors should be applied. It is applied to three renewable energy technologies - photovoltaics, wind on-shore and wind off-shore- in the European Union Member States in the 2008-2012 period. The results using this novel methodology broadly confirm the figures provided in other contributions in the literature. The proposed methodology can be instrumental in assessing the socio-economic effects of policies and investment programmes targeting the deployment of renewable energy technologies.},

abstract = {The paper reviews the history and the economics of the French PWR program, which is arguably the most successful nuclear-scale up experience in an industrialized country. Key to this success was a unique institutional framework that allowed for centralized decision making, a high degree of standardization, and regulatory stability, epitomized by comparatively short reactor construction times. Drawing on largely unknown public records, the paper reveals for the first time both absolute as well as yearly and specific reactor costs and their evolution over time. Its most significant finding is that even this most successful nuclear scale-up was characterized by a substantial escalation of real-term construction costs. Conversely, operating costs have remained remarkably flat, despite lowered load factors resulting from the need for load modulation in a system where base-load nuclear power plants supply three quarters of electricity. The French nuclear case illustrates the perils of the assumption of robust learning effects resulting in lowered costs over time in the scale-up of large-scale, complex new energy supply technologies. The uncertainties in anticipated learning effects of new technologies might be much larger that often assumed, including also cases of "negative learning" in which specific costs increase rather than decrease with accumulated experience. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The European Union aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95{\%} in 2050 compared to 1990 levels. The transition towards a low-carbon economy implies the almost complete decarbonization of Europe's power sector, which could be achieved along various pathways. In this paper, we evaluate the economic implications of alternative energy policies for Europe's power sector by applying a linear dynamic electricity system optimization model in over 36 scenarios. We find that the costs of decarbonizing Europe's power sector by 2050 vary between 139 and 633bn €2010, which corresponds to an increase of between 11{\%} and 44{\%} compared to the total system costs when no CO2 reduction targets are implemented. In line with economic theory, the decarbonization of Europe's power sector is achieved at minimal costs under a stand-alone CO2 reduction target, which ensures competition between all low-carbon technologies. If, however, renewable energies are exempted from competition via supplementary renewable energy (RES-E) targets or if investments in new nuclear and CCS power plants are politically restricted, the costs of decarbonization significantly rise. Moreover, we find that the excess costs of supplementary RES-E targets depend on the acceptance of alternative low carbon technologies. For example, given a complete nuclear phase-out in Europe by 2050 and politically implemented restrictions on the application of CCS to conventional power plants, supplementary RES-E targets are redundant. While in such a scenario the overall costs of decarbonization are comparatively high, the excess costs of supplementary RES-E targets are close to zero. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We develop a dispatch and investment model to study the role of power storage and other exibility options in a green eld setting with high shares of renewables. The model captures multiple system values of power storage related to arbitrage, dispatchable capacity, and reserves. In a baseline scenario, we nd that power storage requirements remain moderate up to a renewable share of around 80{\%}, as other options on both the supply side and demand side also o er exibility at low cost. Yet storage plays an important role in the provision of reserves. If the renewable share increases to 100{\%}, the required capacities of power storage and other technologies increase strongly. As long-run parameter assumptions are highly uncertain, we carry out a range of sensitivity analyses, for example, with respect to the costs and availabilities of storage and renewables. A common nding of these sensitivities is that {\{} under very high renewable shares {\{} the storage requirement strongly depends on the costs and availability of other exibility options, particularly on biomass availability. We conclude that power storage becomes an increasingly important element of a transition towards a fully renewable-based power system. Power storage gains further relevance if other potential sources of exibility are less developed. Supporting the development of power storage should thus be considered a useful component of policies designed to safeguard the transition towards renewables.}}},

@article{Hirth2016,
abstract = {abstract Previous studiesfind that the economic value of electricity (USD/MWh) generated bywind power drops with in- creasingmarket share. Differentmeasures can help mitigate the value drop, including electricity storage, flexible conventional plants, expansion of transmission, and demand response. This study assesses another option: a change in design of wind power plants. “Advanced” wind turbines that are higher and have a larger rotor com- pared to rated capacity (lower specific rating) generate electricity more constantly than “classical” turbines. Re- cent years have witnessed a significant shift towards such advanced technology. Our model-based analysis for Northwestern Europe shows that such design can substantially increase the spotmarket value of generated electricity. At a 30{\%} penetration rate, the value of 1MWh of electricity generated froma fleet of advanced turbines is estimated to be15{\%}higher thanthevalue of 1MWhfromclassical turbines. The additional value is large,whether compared to wind generation costs, to the value drop, or to the effect of alternative measures such as electricity storage. Extensive sensitivity tests indicate that this finding is remarkably robust. The increase in bulk power value is not the only advantage of advanced turbines: additional benefits might accrue from reduced costs for power grids and balancing services. To fully realize this potential, power markets and support policies need to be appropriately designed and signal scarcity investors.},

@article{Newbery2015,
abstract = {In the energy trilemma of reliability, sustainability and affordability, politicians treat reliability as over-riding. The EU assumes the energy-only Target Electricity Model will deliver reliability but the UK argues that a capacity remuneration mechanism is needed. This paper argues that capacity auctions tend to over-procure capacity, exacerbating the missing money problem they were designed to address. The bias is further exacerbated by failing to address some of the missing market problems also neglected in the debate. It examines the case for, criticisms of, and outcome of the first GB capacity auction and problems of trading between different capacity markets.},

abstract = {The goal of this project was to compare and contrast utility scale power plant characteristics used in data sets that support energy market models. Characteristics include both technology cost and technology performance projections to the year 2050. Cost parameters include installed capital costs and operation and maintenance (O{\&}M) costs. Performance parameters include plant size, heat rate, capacity factor or availability factor, and plant lifetime. Conventional, renewable, and emerging electricity generating technologies were considered. Six data sets, each associated with a different model, were selected. Two of the data sets represent modeled results, not direct model inputs. These two data sets include cost and performance improvements that result from increased deployment as well as resulting capacity factors estimated from particular model runs; other data sets represent model input data. For the technologies contained in each data set, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) was also evaluated, according to published cost, performance, and fuel assumptions. http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/48595.pdf},
